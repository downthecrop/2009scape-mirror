### Pull Requests
* Pull Requests should ALWAYS be made into the development branch and ONLY the development branch.
* Please try to include as much detail as you can/follow the template provided for pull requests.

### Code Guidelines
* ALL new code MUST be Kotlin. The only exception is when modifying old java files, in which case we would still *prefer* that it be converted to Kotlin if possible.
* Code must be clean
* You must include a javadoc-style comment at the top of each file stating the file's purpose and your @author tag. Ex: @author Ceikry
* If you are making significant changes to a file that already has a tagged author, add yours below theirs.
* If you are completely rewriting a file, you may replace the @author tag with your own. Rewrites should only be done when the resulting improvements are significant.
* If you come across a file without a mentioned @author, it's a safe bet that it was written by Ceikry. Feel free to add his @author tag to that file.
* You are responsible for the bugs your code causes. If your code results in a bug, you are expected to fix it yourself.
