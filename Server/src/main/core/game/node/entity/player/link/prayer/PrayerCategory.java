 * Players can also use some Prayers at the same time with others, though doing
 * so will compound the drain rate of these Prayers. Some Prayers cannot be used
 * simultaneously and are marked in the table with the same background colour.
 * For example, activating the "Smite" Prayer while the Protect From
 * Melee" Prayer is active will automatically deactivate "Protect from Melee" as
 * they are incompatible Prayers.
