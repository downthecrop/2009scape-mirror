## Fishing Trawler Solo-player Guide
### Notes
* You require level 15 fishing to play this minigame.
* This minigame is not 100% authentic.

### Inventory Setup

* 100-200 Swamp Paste
* 3-4 Bailing Buckets
* 12-16 Ropes

### Playing the game
When you first start the game you'll be prompted with a brief tutorial telling you <br/>
what each item does. You should plug leaks as fast as possible as the boat <br/>
can fill with water very quickly. Occasionally, the net will rip. Go on the top deck <br/>
and inspect the net in order to repair it. If your net is good and all leaks <br/>
are already plugged, spam click your bailing buckets to remove water as fast as <br/>
possible.

### Rewards
Our fishing trawler has all the authentic rewards, including:
* Raw Shrimp
* Raw Sardine
* Raw Anchovie
* Raw Lobster
* Raw Manta Ray
* Raw Sea Turtle
* Raw Sharks
* Various Junk Items

However, somewhat inauthentically, I wanted to make this minigame <br/>
somewhat worth doing, as in its vanilla state it is pretty much <br/>
pointless. So all the above fish can be caught at any level, and <br/>
there's been a few inauthentic rewards added. Those are as follows:
* Loop half of key
* Tooth half of key
* Caskets (can award gems, coins, talismans, and a few other things)
* Pirate's Hat (very rare)
* Lucky Cutlass (very rare)

### Experience
I tweaked how experience is gained as well, again to make this somewhat worth doing.
The exact formula for experience gained at x1 xp is: <br/>
`((1.5% of Fishing Level) * Fishing Level) * Number of Fish Caught`
<br/>
What this generally works out to mean is that at level 99, you get roughly<br/>
20k experience per trip at x1 xp at level 99, and 438.75 xp per trip at x1 <br/>
at level 15. These are both based on catching around 130 fish, which is the expected <br/>
average when soloing. 

### Other players
Playing with more players is more relaxed but you get less fish <br/>
and xp, as the haul is divided evenly between all players.
